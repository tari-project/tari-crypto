/// A `DeterministicRandomizer` contains utility functions for working with pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) where
/// reproducibility is important. While the `rand` crate has functionality for things like uniform sampling and
/// shuffling that can be used with PRNGs, there is no guarantee that these functions will always be implemented in the
/// same way across versions, which could lead to incompatibility or dependency troubles. This library has no specific
/// `rand` dependency, and implements deterministic sampling and shuffling that are implemented in straightforward ways
/// that will work identically across platforms. If you provide the same seed to the PRNG, you'll get the same results.
/// This can be useful for cases like consensus applications, when a set of clients need to agree on pseudorandom
/// results.
///
/// To avoid certain pitfalls, you need to choose a cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) that
/// implements `CryptoRng + RngCore + SeedableRng`; a good choice is something like `ChaCha12Rng` from the `rand_chacha`
/// crate (which happens to be the current `rand` default).
///
/// Once you instantiate the `DeterministicRandomizer` with your CSPRNG and a starting seed, you can start generating
/// bounded pseudorandom numbers or sampling or shuffling arrays deterministically. You can always reseed the randomizer
/// with a different seed, or reset it to the initial seed.

/// // We'll just make one arbitrarily; it must be `[u8; N]` with `N <= 32`
/// let seed = [1u8; 32];
/// let mut randomizer = DeterministicRandomizer::<ChaCha12Rng>::new(seed);

/// // We can also reseed using a new seed
/// // This has the same effect as creating a fresh `DeterministicRandomizer` with the new seed
/// let new_seed = [2u8; 32];
/// randomizer.reseed(new_seed);
